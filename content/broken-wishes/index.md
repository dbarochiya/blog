> I’m thinking about   
> what you and I could be  
> we could be us  
> we could be in love

> Now time has passed   
> and nothing happened  
> neither that walk  
> nor that ride

> I wish I could be that guy   
> whom you were talking about   
> someone with magical smile  
> someone with magnetic charm

> Now I want to go back   
> and turn around the time  
> when I saw your smile  
> smile that wasn’t for me
