walking down the street with,

sleepless nights   
chasing deadlines   
overthinking mind  
oh so lost me

And then i saw the alluring eyes of you ,

window of your soul  
full of mystery  
deep in there   
oh i found me

O girl you made my day  
you took my pain away  
you made me alive   
you made my life

And Now I am wide awake  
now I am ready to fight  
now I am ready to smile  
now I am ready to live

O girl you made my day  
you took my pain away  
you made me alive   
you made my life
