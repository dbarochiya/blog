Have you ever realized that there is something horribly wrong with you and you need to change it? I also had that realization moment about my self that there is so many stuff that is really bad with me and I definitely want to improve myself. I started exploring the mind palace and noting down everything into the excel sheet — then I made a few columns like :

-   Am I happy with this particular behavior/habit?
-   Do I need to change this?
-   What are the steps I can follow to make progress?

Below section, I will compile observations I made during the process of improving/changing the habits that I compiled in the list.

#### Compulsive sexual behavior

**Premise >** It has been there since a very very long time, this thing has made it roots to my head. I realized it very lately that masturbating almost every day is not the ‘NORMAL’ thing to do. I could not control my hands and my thoughts.

After getting introduced to sexual content on the Internet by my friend during my High school years ( 9th Standard), I remember reading sex stories on the internet and masturbating after my parents got to sleep. I can still remember the feel of the dopamine running through my veins. That time I used to think of this as adventures and I never realized that those adventures became a habit — a really bad habit — which got more and more deeply rooted into my biological system over the years. It became a therapy for me — whenever I was under stress I used to masturbate a lot. Especially during the board exam days when these sessions weren’t limited only tonights — it came out to days and I was merely focusing on my studies while I was alone in the bedroom ( as we didn’t have much space in our 1BHK — bedroom was my study room during the daytime). I remember an incident during those exam days, I had already masturbated many times during the day and my penis was already hurting, but I couldn’t keep my hands off my penis and masturbated one more time — my body couldn’t take it well — I wasn’t able to sleep whole night due to the pain. My sleep cycle also changed very readily due to this as I was more awake in the nights than the day (We had reading time during those days so no need to wake up early in the morning) but I thought it is natural and I am just a night person. Even my parents used to believe that. Somehow I was able to perform well in the exams and chose ‘science’ stream to continue my educational career.

Then comes the year when I got two good things in my life

1.  Personal android phone ( Intex aqua N15)
2.  Physics

I really loved solving the physics problems — mechanics, electromagnetism, optics. After completing those ‘usual’ sessions, I used to take out H.C Verma during the nights and solve the problems — I never bothered about Mathematics and Chemistry.

As I got my personal phone, I was reading more stories than ever. It clearly became the habit what started as a stress relieving mechanism. I was exploring more of the darker world out there and reading the kind of text one should not read. There are literally novels out there to read. I used to picture me as the character of the story I was reading and live every word of the story by imagining it. Along with the time I got so better at imagination that, I was blending real-life incidents happened with me into the stories and creating my own version of the story. It was exciting at that time, but I feel this was at par most disturbing.

That bad habit continued and begun ever more problematic for me during my college time. As I had to share my room with my roommate, there were fewer chances during the day I get to do my stuff. And my roommate was a night person, he used to go to bed very late. I started getting awake until my roommate got to sleep and then enjoy my privacy time.

This is a total waste of my energy — it definitely took a toll on my health and I wasn’t able to sit for long hours during the lower back pain. The more than the impact it had on my social and phycological behavior was very vast. I was getting mood swings, I was keeping me away from the people. I wasn’t able to cope up in education. I lost my scholarship due to low-grade performance in my studies and that scholarship mattered **a lot** for me and my family. I delayed telling my parents about this until a very long time because I didn’t know how to face them and tell them that I failed you.

There is a wired thing with me that — I keep calm outside and never let anyone know that what is going underneath my head. Even if I am shit scared, I don’t show it to others even not to my close friends. I don’t know it is a good thing or not, but it helped me during those days to complete my day to day work without letting anyone know that what I am going through. It was like I am just an average kid like many others in the college who hasn’t much interest in the computer science and just surviving — bunking lectures and putting efforts just to pass the exams to complete the graduation.

Underneath I knew that — this is wrong — I need to change this. I even tried a few times to fight. I brought a calendar with me from my house during one of the breaks. I used to mark a cross on the calendar on the days I masturbated. The longest I survived was five days but eventually, I went back again and again on that path. After getting failed multiple times I gave up and chose the easy path. I accepted that it is the part of my personality and I have to live with that rather than fighting for it.

It continued to haunt me during the nights and after I used to feel like a failure after masturbating. It used to trigger a constant stream of thoughts about my future and career. Sometimes I used to do random things to keep me distracted from the thoughts. I used to listen to music, write some poems, small fictional stories, POCs on wired business ideas, sketching to get rid of the constant stream of thoughts during the nights.

Then came the moment when I need to pay the tuition fees for the next winter semester and I had to tell my parents that I lost my scholarship for that year. I still wonder from where I got the courage to face my parents, but it turned out not that bad. They reacted in shock first, but nothing more than that — just one line my father told me that — ‘ take care from the next time’. It was revealing to me.

The semester after this incident turned out well for me, there were two major things that helped me somehow,

-   Lectures in the afternoon — generally we had lectures in the morning but that semester university changed the lecture timings.
-   Introduction to Quantum Mechanics — one and only fundamental physics related course offered during my time at the university.

These two things worked out pretty well for me and I attended more lectures in that semester alone than the last three semester combined. And needless to say, I scored highest of all semester in that semester. I even joined the gym for two months (from mid-December — 2018 until the end of February — 2018). But even during those days, my night routine was still there.

Then comes the placement season, I wasn’t that good on the coding front as lack of practice in the competitive programming but I liked exploring Data-structures and use of them. In the starting two months, I wasn’t even able to crack initial screening of the hiring process and it affected me a lot — my compulsive behavior was all-time high at that time — I lost confidence in myself and just took an irrational decision of sitting any company that comes next. You won’t believe that I got an offer from the very next company after that and another offer from a decent company following next to that company.

Should I write the next part of my life?

Week — 3 (8/4/2019)

It was showing real progress this time, until the last night. I don’t know I woke up suddenly at night and wasn’t able to go to sleep again, there were thoughts about the future in my head (I have been reading a book ‘Power of Habits’ and I really liked it. I was thinking of pursuing masters in these kinds of studies) It was really confusing and my hand started automatically exploring my body. I tried hard to hold my self, I tried to distract myself by listening to songs but I couldn’t — I couldn't sleep and the only possible way out of that situation I felt was to give up. And I let down the mental shield I was building since the last few days. I felt really guilty after that — I felt like crying but there were no tears because I was more ashamed of myself than I felt pity for my situation. The only thing running in my mids was that I want to be a really great person but there is no chance I would be with the will power I possess. I woke up late that day — In the morning, I did it again. I wasn’t able to focus on anything all day, the thought of losing the battle is constantly running through my head. So I thought of confessing it to myself that I lost and also promising me that I will fight again and I will win. Now Onwards, I will write it down whenever I encounter these kinds of situations.
